      "Where can I find the best tech venues in London?\n",
      "If you're looking for a venue that reflects the spirit of innovation and creativity that is inherent in your company, go for the spaces in the heart of the city, near the major transport hubs. The best tech venues are located in Central London, which is known as the Silicon Roundabout. It is conveniently located near Victoria Station and Pimlico Tube Station, which also gives you easy access to public transportation. You can also find some of the best tech venues in London in Shoreditch and Canary Wharf. These areas are popular among tech companies, startups and entrepreneurs. If you’re looking for a more laid-back vibe, you can find tech venues in East London that are close to Hoxton Square. The best thing about this location is that it's easily accessible from Heathrow Airport and Gatwick Airport.\n",
      "What are some of the best venues for holding tech events in London?\n",
      "Weston Roof Pavilion at Southbank Centre. This is one of our favourites. It's got a beautiful view and plenty of room to spread out. Plus, it's located right on the Thames, so guests can enjoy the view of Big Ben, Parliament and other iconic buildings. The venue is also located near Waterloo Station in a popular area that's close to many restaurants and bars, so it makes for a great place to hold an after-party.\n",
      "Landing Forty Two. If you're looking for a place to hold a large tech event in London, it's probably time to stop looking and just book this venue. With plenty of flexible space, this is the perfect venue for tech conferences, conventions, launch parties and startup events. They have customisable lighting and sound installation that can transform the space into something truly magical.\n",
      "The View. This venue is a new, stunning, multi-purpose event space in the heart of Holborn. It is part of The Royal College of Surgeons of England, which acts as the professional home of surgery in England and internationally, ever since 1800. Wood tiled interior walls and bespoke modern lamps lend a contemporary and luxurious character to this venue, which sets it apart from the rest. If you are looking for a pompous and impressive venue for your tech event, this is a perfect choice.\n",
      "What are the best neighbourhoods for tech events in London?\n",
      "Shoreditch stands out for its innovative spaces and creative vibe. Canary Wharf is another top choice, offering sleek, modern venues for larger conferences and gatherings. South Bank and the City of London are fit for various tech events, providing spaces that range from traditional conference halls to advanced seminar rooms. Lastly, Kings Cross has emerged as a tech hub with the redevelopment of the area, offering modern facilities within striking architectural landmarks. \n",

The space was exceptionally well-equipped for hosting events, with every detail thoughtfully considered — including all the extras that make a real difference.\n",

I was single-handedly organising an event for circa 25 guests plus a few suppliers, so I had a lot to plan and organise. The venue team were SO helpful (Sasha and Ed, so appreciate you both!) their communication was fast, they referred me to great suppliers for catering (the guests LOVED the food from their recommended caterers), and honestly the whole day was just perfect. The venue, the sound, the freedom that we had to use the space and it's tucked away from any members of the public so you really have the place to yourself to create your own world. My guests absolutely loved it, and I'm just in awe. Hire this place and this team, you wouldn't regret it.
